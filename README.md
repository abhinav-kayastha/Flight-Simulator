Before running the prototype, make sure to download MariaDB and change the user's name and password on line 52 and 53 respectively (on main.py), to your own respective password and username in order to run the code. Additionally make a database called "flight_game" and run the SQL file (Flight Game Prototype DB.sql) to get the necessary airport data.
